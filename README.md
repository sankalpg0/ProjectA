Terraform AWS Infrastructure Provisioning

Welcome to this repository! This project contains Terraform scripts for provisioning and managing AWS infrastructure. The code is structured into three key files: main.tf, provider.tf, and variables.tf.

Overview

This project automates the deployment of AWS resources using Terraform, enabling consistent and repeatable infrastructure management.

Key Features:

Infrastructure-as-Code: Define, provision, and manage AWS resources declaratively.

Modular Structure: Logical separation of Terraform configurations into main.tf, provider.tf, and variables.tf for readability and reusability.

Customizable: Easily configurable variables for tailoring the infrastructure to your needs.

Repository Structure

main.tf:

Defines the AWS resources to be provisioned (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs).

provider.tf:

Specifies the AWS provider configuration (e.g., region, credentials).

variables.tf:

Declares input variables for customizable resource parameters.

Prerequisites

Terraform: Install Terraform if not already installed.

AWS CLI: Ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the appropriate access keys.

AWS Account: Required to provision AWS resources.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Validate the configuration:

terraform validate

Plan the infrastructure changes:

terraform plan

Apply the changes to provision resources:

terraform apply

Configuration

Customize the infrastructure by modifying the variables in variables.tf. Example:

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

You can override default values using a terraform.tfvars file or via the command line:

terraform apply -var 'region=us-west-2'

Clean-Up

To destroy the infrastructure and avoid unnecessary costs:

terraform destroy

Best Practices

Use version control to track changes to your Terraform configurations.

Test configurations in a non-production environment before applying them in production.

Secure sensitive data, such as access keys, using tools like AWS Secrets Manager or Terraform Cloud.
